# Model Card: Agent Based Pathway Generator

Following [Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [Lessons from
Archives (Jo & Gebru)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.10389.pdf), we're providing some information about the agent based pathway generator within this repository.

## Model Details

The implementation of the agent based pathway generator within this repository was created as part of an NHSX Analytics Unit commission in 2021.  This model card describes the first version of the model, released in March 2021.  Further information about the model implementation can be found in the associated [report](./reports/REDACTED_C245 ABM Patient Pathways_Final Report_V3_28042021.cleaned.pdf).

## Model Use

This model is still in development.  

### Intended Use

This model is intended to be the foundations for other work to build from.  The data model and environment have been developed to allow a range of intelligence layers to be implmented on top.  This means the intented use ranges from visualising a patient pathway and generating synthetic pathways for development and testing of healthcare tools, to impact analysis of policy chagnge to pathways or incentives. 

### Out-of-Scope Use Cases

This model is not suitable for clinical decision making.

## Training Data

No data is required to train and initiate the generator

## Performance and Limitations

To be updated.
